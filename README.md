# Spring 2025 CS 351 Project
Insert project description here

# Directory structure
- Nerd stuff that you don't need to worry about:
  -  `flake.nix`, `flake.lock`, `.envrc`
- Git files
  - `.gitignore`: Put file or directory (folder) names that you want git to ignore in here
  - `.gitattributes`: This file sets some git settings. This is mostly used here just so line endings aren't weird. Windows and Linux end lines differently, so sometimes just by saving a file, you can have 100's of "changes"
- Project description files
  - `LICENSE`: Describes how people can use our source code
  - `README.md`: This file! It's normally used to explain the project
- Source files
  - Found in the directory/folder `src/`
